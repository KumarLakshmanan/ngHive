Hii all

Today task is to set up your development environment. 

You'll need to download and install the following things.

### 1. Flutter SDK
Download the Flutter SDK from the Flutter official website by following this documentation. 

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Please confirm you added the Flutter SDK path to your environment variables.

### 2. Android Studio

Then install the Android studio using https://developer.android.com/studio

It will automatically install the Android SDK and other tools required for Flutter development.


Go to your Android Studio Preferences -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK -> SDK Tools -> Check the following

    * Android SDK Build-Tools
    * Android SDK Platform-Tools
    * Android SDK Command-line Tools

### 3. Visual Studio Code

Install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* **Note:** You can use any other IDE of your choice. But I recommend using Visual Studio Code.

### 4. Git
Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then run the flutter doctor command to make sure everything is set up correctly.
and take a screenshot of the output and post it in the group.
